# ConnectFour is a two-player game where each player drops discs onto a grid to make a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal row of four discs of the same color. The grid has seven columns and six rows. Discs are dropped into the grid vertically. 

# Each player then takes turns to drop their disc color into the grid to make four-in-a-row or stop their opponent from making four-in-a-row.
